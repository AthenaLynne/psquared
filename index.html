    <h1 class="about_me"> I began this journey in 2024 because I was tired of working all week for someone else. I decided it was time to gamble on myself and start a business. Slowly, and methodically I began collecting things for my garage. It started as a blank canvas, literally down to the studs. In order for me to use it as my workshop I needed to finish it out. With the help of a few buddies and my dad I set to work adding insulation and finishing out the walls. Then I got some new wiring ran- shout out to my dad, Love ya- and got a 220 plug installed. Next came the air compressor, which is massive. Then the oven and finally the sand blaster. After all that was done, I realized no garage was ever really complete with out A/C and a row of shot lights. Now that that is installed- PSquared is officially open for business. Come on by!</h1>
